# Instructions for running the application

#Main Application

The Application has been created as a console App using the SpringFramework (for dependency injection) and has been tested to be working. The output data generated calculates the total cost of shopping basket. 

The console output will display the basket items and the total cost of the basket. 

To run the project, go the **ShoppingBasketApp** file and run the application. 

**Since I do not have access to Intellij Ultimate, the application was initially written using Maven and then converted to using SpringFramework to implement dependency injection**

#Unit Tests

The units tests are working and there should be no failing tests.

1) Lombok
